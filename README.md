# Multimodal RAG Based Clinical Language Models
• Utilizing RAG for developing clinical language models to increase the accuracy of medical text summarization and improve
domain-specific responses to complex clinical questions, including a comparative analysis using OpenAI's RAG API on GPT-3.
• Strategized the expansion of the model’s capabilities to incorporate multimodal data inputs, paving the way for integrating
Medical imaging with electronic health records using LLaVa


Working on it : updated soon :
