Working on it : updated soon :


â€¢ Utilizing RAG for developing clinical language models to increase the accuracy of medical text summarization and improve
domain-specific responses to complex clinical questions, including a comparative analysis using OpenAI's RAG API on GPT-3.
â€¢ Strategized the expansion of the modelâ€™s capabilities to incorporate multimodal data inputs, paving the way for integrating
Medical imaging with electronic health records using LLaVa
